This is a TO DO LIST project created based on EXPRESS.js, EJS, BODY-PARSER and pgADMIN (postgreSQL).

It's created based on CRUD methodology, therefore you can Create, Read, Update and Delete any itmes.

In order to work you need to install pgAdmin and create a new database. Also create a new table called "items" with 2 columns (ID - serial and Title - VARCHAR(100) Not Null).
All the details below can be modified as you wish, here are just mine used for the project.

  user: "postgres",
  host: "localhost",
  database: "permalist",
  password: "admin",
  port: "5432"
